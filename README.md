## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) - for the styling
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I learnt how to set up SASS in a project.
I used Github's live SASS compiler to compile the SASS into CSS and I think I find it easier to use compared to using the terminal.

I learnt the use of variables in SASS and nesting selectors, I find it totally awesome!

### Continued development

I would definitely love to deep dive more into SASS.
This is the first project that I'll work on using SAS and I'd like to know more about when to use a mixin and whne to use inheritance.
